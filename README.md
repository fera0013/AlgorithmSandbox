# AlgorithmSandbox

This repository contains my implementations of different algorithms, using modern C++14 features. Some of the implementations were used to pass the programming assignments of the [Stanford Algorithms Spezialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms). 

The code was implemented against the Visual Studio 2017 C++14 compiler. Algorithm implementations can be found in the /Algorithms subfolder, the corresponding test code in /AlgorithmsTests. 

To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Open Algorithms.sln in a VS2017-compatible version of Visual Studio
2. Build the solution by right clicking it in the Project explorer and selecting "Rebuild Solution" 
3. Open Test Explorer from menu "Test->Window->Test Explorer"
4. Select "Run all" in Test Explorer
