# AlgorithmSandbox

This repository contains my implementations of different algorithms, using modern C++14 features. Some of the implementations were used to pass the programming assignments of the stanford algorithms course at https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms. 

The code was implemented against the Visual Studio 2017 C++14 compiler. Algorithm implementations can be found in the /Algorithms subfolder, the corresponding test code in /AlgorithmsTests. 

Open Algorithms.sln in a VS2017-compatible version of Visual studio, open Test Explorer and select "Run all",
